    "hint": "I is a subject pronoun. You can use it as the subject of a sentence. It tells that the speaker is doing something, and it is usually at the beginning of the sentence. <br> Example - I hug Rick. The subject pronoun I is the subject of the sentence. <br> Me is an object pronoun. You can use it after an action verb. <br> Example - Rick hugs me. The object pronoun me is used after an action verb, hugs. <br> When a pronoun is connected to a noun with the word and (like Rick and I or Rick and me), it can be hard to tell which pronoun is correct. To tell which one is correct, look at the sentence without the other noun. <br> Example - Rick and I like the teacher. I like the teacher. I is used as the subject of the sentence. <br> Example - The teacher likes Rick and me. The teacher likes me. Me is used after the action verb, likes.",
