Example - My friends walk along the path. <br> A <b>sentence fragment </b> is a group of words that does not express a complete thought. It is usually missing a subject or a verb. <br> Example - Knows the answer. This is a sentence fragment. It is missing a subject. Who knows the answer? She knows the answer. <br> Example -The bright red car. This is a sentence fragment. It is missing a verb. What did the bright red car do? The bright red car stopped. <br> A <b> run-on sentence </b> also called a <b> run-together sentence </b>, is made up of two sentences that should stand alone. <br> Example - I knocked on the door it opened. <br> To fix a run-on sentence, separate it into two sentences. Add a full stop after the first sentence, and use a capital letter at the beginning of the second sentence. Example - I knocked on the door. It opened.",
