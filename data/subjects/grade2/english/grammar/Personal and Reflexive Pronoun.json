Subject (singular) Reflexive pronoun I myself you yourself she herself he himself it itself Subject (plural)    Reflexive pronoun we ourselves you yourselves they themselves Reflexive pronouns are used to refer back to the subject of a sentence. They should match the subject. <br> Example - We helped ourselves to some more soup. The subject of the sentence is we, so use ourselves. <br> Example - Amy drives herself to work every morning. The subject of the sentence, Amy, can be called she, so use herself. <br> A reflexive pronoun can only be used to refer to the subject. To refer to someone else or something else, a personal pronoun, like me, you, him, her, it, us or them, should be used instead. <br> Example - Jake wrote a note for himself. The reflexive pronoun, himself, refers back to the subject, Jake. <br> Example -Jake wrote a note for him. The personal pronoun, him, must refer to someone other than the subject, Jake.",
