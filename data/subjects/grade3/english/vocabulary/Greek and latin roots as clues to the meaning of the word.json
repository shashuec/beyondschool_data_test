        "hint": "A root is a part of a word that has a certain meaning. <br> Words that share the same root often have similar meanings that are related to the meaning of the root. For Example -: The root phon means sound. A xylophone is a musical instrument with wooden bars that are hit by small hammers. <br> <b> Homophones </b> are words that sound the same but have different meanings. A telephone is a machine that can carry the sound of someone's voice over a long distance. All of these meanings relate to the concept of sound. <br> You can use your knowledge of roots to figure out the meaning of words you haven't seen before. For Example -: The root cyclo means circle or wheel. The root meter means measure. A cyclometer is a device that measures how many times a wheel turns.",
